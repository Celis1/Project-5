## Problem 3: Optimizing Evacuation Routes using Real-Time Traffic Information

### Problem Statement:

- During disasters, search and rescue teams must be able to search for and get to survivors as fast as possible (in terms of travel time and distance)
- Current GIS and navigation systems allow responders to calculate travel time and distance between origin and destination and propose an optimal route to the destination.
- However, many of the current platforms do not rely on real-time data (e.g. road closures, damaged roads etc.) and can produce inaccurate or inefficient results.
- This project will leverage social media, news feeds and other datasets (e.g. Waze, Here.com) to identify real time road closures or damaged roads, power outages and other blocked routes that may affect traffic lights, travel time, travel safety and more.
- The system should allow the user (the public or rescue teams) to search for any of these conditions and identify if and where they exist in a specific location (street, neighborhood, city etc.)

## Desired Deliverables:

- A short write-up describing the project.
- An open source code that pulls live information from social media and/or news feeds about road closures, road conditions, damaged roads, power outages etc. which may affect travel and accessibility.
- The output can be either tabular (e.g. allow for search of names of closed roads) or geospatial (e.g. produce a map of real-time road closures).
